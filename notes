If you wind up using vector rotation code w/o clipping, you'll have to rewrite it for CUDA kernels.

You also need to do the same exact function for translating the point array so they match on the new image, as it'll have modified the canvas size.
The cheaters way to do this is to run it again on the new image post rotation
